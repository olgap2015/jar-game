<h2>Guess How Many Are in the Jar Game</h2>
<p>This Project is a Console version of a popular game where a player needs to guess how many items are in the jar.</p>
<p>Here are the features that are planned to be implemented:</p>
<ul>
  <li>As an administrator of the game I should be able to specify what type of item will be stored in the jar as well as the total how many could reasonably fit in jar, so that the game stays in the bounds of reality.</li>
  <li>As a player of the game, each game I should be presented with a randomly filled jar so that I can play multiple games and it is still challenging.</li>
  <li>As a player of the game, I should be displayed with the maximum number of items that are possible to be in the jar.</li>
  <li>As a player of the game, I should be able to guess the number of the items until I get the correct answer.</li>
  <li>As a winner of the game, I should know how many attempts it took me to get to the right answer, so that I am encouraged to beat my score.</li>
